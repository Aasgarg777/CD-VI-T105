 AST Generation: Builds a hierarchical AST structure from POS-tagged tokens.

 Interactive Visualization: AST is dynamically rendered on a web canvas.

 Grammar Parsing: Detects noun phrases, verb phrases, and prepositional phrases.

💻 Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Canvas-based drawing)

Backend: Python + Flask

Custom Modules: lexer.py and parser.py for NLP logic
