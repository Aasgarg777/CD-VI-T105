# About the Project: From Text to Tree - A Lexical Parsing Approach

This project transforms input English text into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using lexical and syntactic parsing. It includes both a desktop GUI (Tkinter) and a web interface (Flask).

### 🔧 Core Python Files

1. **main1.py**
   - The main execution script that integrates the lexer and parser.
   - Handles the flow from input to AST generation and passes output to the visualizer.

2. **lexer.py**
   - Performs lexical analysis (tokenization and part-of-speech tagging).
   - Uses files like `noun.txt`, `verb.txt`, etc., for identifying POS categories.
   - Prepares structured tokens for parsing.

3. **parser.py**
   - Parses tokens from the lexer to build a syntactic structure.
   - Implements logic to construct the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
   - May use recursive methods to define grammar rules.

### 📁 Folder Structure

- **/gui/**
  - Contains scripts for graphical user interfaces.
    - `app.py`: Tkinter-based desktop application


- **/pos_tags/**
  - Stores part-of-speech definition files:
    - `noun.txt`, `verb.txt`, `adjective.txt`, etc.
  - These are referenced by `lexer.py` to tag input text.

- **/static/**
  - Contains static files used by the web interface.
    - `style.css`: Styles for the web app.
    - `script.js`: JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., animations, button actions).

- **/templates/**
  - Stores HTML templates for Flask.
    - `index.html`: Main interface page of the web app.

### 📌 Summary
Each component is modular, making the project scalable and maintainable. Together, they form a complete pipeline from plain text input to syntactic tree output.
